In other words, there is a 3/5 chance that the one is not all the way to the left or right (and thus placing it in a corner) because we are only concerned with the first and last row of the Latin square, we just simply square that 3/5 probability to get the probability that there isn't a one on any of the corners.\n",

        "For the extra credit, take the example where a one is on the top left corner and a 2 is on the top right corner (it doesn't matter what numbers you pick so long that they follow the distinct number criteria of a Latin square row). We already know that there is a 3/5 chance that a one is not on the corner of a row so there is a 2/5 chance that a one is in one of the bottom corners and thus two of the corners matching criteria is already met. The other 3/5 of the time when the one is not on a corner, there is a 2/4 chance that the two is on the edge since there are only four remaining spots (the one takes up one of the five) and two of them are corners. We then take add the probabilities of these two events to get the final answer."
