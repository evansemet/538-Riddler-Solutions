She notices that every 10-digit number seems to have an interesting property: It is either a multiple of 11, or it can be made a multiple of 11 by changing a single digit. For example, there are several ways to make the 10-digit number 5551234567 into a multiple of 11, such as changing the first digit to 4.\n",
